Study and optimization of the bioinformatics software used by Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre}{Bioinformatics, parallelism, codeml, PAML, samtools} In this paper we studied and optimized the performance bottlenecks found in the bioinformatics software used by the genetics research group from Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA), employing parallel programming techniques to achieve these goals. The focus of our work was in the phylogenetic analysis software called codeml, from the PAML package, which is widely used in the literature, as well on the variant calling software samtools, also popular. We developed a tool for the parallel execution of samtools jobs, reducing total execution time for the group's input from various days to a few hours, while in the case of codeml we analyzed the performance of solutions found in a bibliography review, supplying the researches with a tool whose execution time is half that of codeml.
