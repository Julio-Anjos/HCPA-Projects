Requirements to generate the executable:
* C++ compiler, e.g. GCC 4
* CMake 2.6 or later recommended, although compilation possible without
* Reasonably new BLAS implementation (e.g. OpenBLAS, Goto2, ACML, MKL); packages from various Linux distributions can be used, but this deteriorates performance (i.e., might even be slower than original CodeML)
* Reasonably new LAPACK library (e.g. original LAPACK or ACML, MKL); packages from various Linux distributions can be used, but this deteriorates performance (i.e., might even be slower than original CodeML)

How to generate the executable:
* Generate BLAS if necessary
* Generate LAPACK if necessary
* Edit CMakeLists.txt if necessary
* "cmake ." in source directory creates a Makefile
* make will create an executable "slimcodeml"

Computer system:
* Linux prefered, but sources are portable to other platforms
